# MetaBase Android App #

This app is the App you see on the App store for Android to use our MetaWear/MetaMotion sensors.

For more information about the MetaWear platform, check out our website at [https://mbientlab.com](https://mbientlab.com).

## Build ##
The API was built in Android Studio 2.3.3 and updated to 4.1.3. 

It is targeted for Android 10/11 (SDK 30/29) with Android N (SDK 24) as the minimum required SDK, and requires a JDK compiler compliance level of 11.

## Note ##
This is a fork where I attempt to learn how does the Metabase app works by making small modifications.
It is by no means an attempt to optimise or improve the app - just to tailor it to my needs.
